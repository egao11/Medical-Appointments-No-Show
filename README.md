# Medical Appointments No-Show

## Overview  
This project explores patient appointment data from Brazil to understand the factors influencing whether patients attend their medical appointments. By analyzing demographic details, medical conditions, and SMS reminders, the project uncovers trends that may impact healthcare efficiency.

## Key Insights  
- Patients receiving SMS reminders were not always more likely to show up.  
- Age, chronic diseases (like diabetes or hypertension), and waiting time between scheduling and the appointment date significantly influenced attendance.  
- Women represented the majority of patients but did not differ greatly in attendance compared to men.  

## Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Tableau for interactive visualization
