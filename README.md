# Medical Appointment No-Show Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of over 100k medical appointments in Brazil to understand **why patients miss their medical appointments**. The analysis focuses on demographics, health conditions, and external factors that may influence attendance.

## 🔍 Key Questions
- Do gender and age affect no-show rates?  
- Do health conditions (like diabetes or hypertension) correlate with attendance?  
- Does the day of the week impact patient reliability?  

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data cleaning & exploration  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and visualization  

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Age**: Younger patients tend to skip more appointments.  
- **Day of Week**: Monday and Saturday show the highest no-show rates.  
- **Gender**: No significant difference between male and female attendance.
